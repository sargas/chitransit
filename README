ChiTransit
===================

ChiTransit is a C program for downloading and showing information about the CTA and PACE around Chicago.

This program is released under the GPLv3 or newer. See the file COPYING for more detail. Most of the src/ directory is copylefted by Joseph Jon Booker. The rest of it may be copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, Openmoko, or Openhand/Intel, see the files themselves for details.

I don't expect to do much to this program once released, although if anyone actually uses it or has any feature requests I'd appreciate hearing about it.
